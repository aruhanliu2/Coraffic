# Goal
simulate and control traffic flow by executing traffic lights logics. Optimize traffic flow rate by building different traffic light control strategies. 

# Priority List on Deliverables 
1. Core: functioning traffic map with moving cars and executable code block ...commands on traffic lights. 
2. High Priority:
..*Integration of JS library of traffic map into simulator environment 
..*Implementation of traffic light coordination system for reference use
..*Implementation of basic traffic light commands(integrate with logic blocks)
...a. Switching between red and green modes
...b. Levels of fixed duration for each mode
...c. Number of cars in map
...d. Speed of cars
3. Medium Priority:
..*dynamic duration for each light mode based on number of cars waiting 
..*Traffic simulator efficiency ratings
..*Adding other types of vehicle
4. Low Priority:
Traffic lights communicate to each other
Integrate with google map
